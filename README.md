This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using wildcard routes ('*') in React Router DOM.  The problem arises when a wildcard route is defined, and it unintentionally intercepts routes that should be handled by other, more specific routes. This can lead to unexpected behavior and broken navigation. The solution presented shows how to restructure routes to avoid this conflict, ensuring proper route matching.
